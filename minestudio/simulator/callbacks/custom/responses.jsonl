The final ratio was 31% oceanic regions, including deep oceans and mushroom islands. Biomes like bamboo jungles, dark forests, snowy mountains, and different hills underwent notable terrain and aesthetic changes. Terrain generation could result in different shadow seeds in Java Edition due to variations in ocean climate zones. Ocean biomes had separate climate zone processes to minimize changes in existing Minecraft seeds. Biome shapes could use only the first 24 bits of the 64-bit world seed, causing biome generation overflow with repeating patterns.

One-way telegraphs and classic telegraphs are practical, with the latter being space-efficient and beginner-friendly, while multi-directional telegraphs require complex wiring.
